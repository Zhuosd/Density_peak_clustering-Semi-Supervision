# Density_peak_clustering-Semi-Supervision
Having a multitude of unlabeled data and few labeled ones is a common problem in many practical ap- plications. A successful methodology to tackle this problem is self-training semi-supervised classification. In this paper, we introduce a method to discover the structure of data space based on find of density peaks. Then, a framework for self-training semi-supervised classification, in which the structure of data space is integrated into the self-training iterative process to help train a better classifier, is proposed. A series of experiments on both artificial and real datasets are run to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our proposed framework has better performance than some previous works in general on both artificial and real datasets, especially when the distribution of data is non-spherical. Besides, we also find that the support vector machine is particularly suitable for our proposed framework to play the role of base classifier.
